Handling Missing Data Project

## Aim:

Real-time continuous glucose monitoring may include continuous sequences of missing values. These missing values can be generated using various techniques to avoid loss of sample data. Our project implements, evaluates and predicts the missing data. To this end, the generated artificial missing data to compare with our ground truth and evaluate how well we generated a random sample of patients. By comparing the accuracy of the algorithms, we can determine which of our approaches to missing data is best for our chosen dataset.

## Dataset:
The CGM of 30 individuals with type 1 diabetes was collected for 1 month. One-third of
patients were in each of the age groups: adolescents, adults, and children. The frequency of the data is one day (1440 data points) which starts at midnight on the first day and a new data point is collected every minute.
